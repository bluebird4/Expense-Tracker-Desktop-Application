# Personal Expense Tracker

An application to track personal expenses and assist in keeping a monthly budget. This application
is meant for use by the general population, aimed specifically at those new to expense tracking and
budgeting.

I chose to create this application as my project because I have little experience in tracking my
expenses, and I would like to start doing so. I don't like any of the expense tracker applications
that are currently available for use, and I would like something more refined than a spreadsheet,
so I decided to make my own application for this purpose.

## Planned Features

Some features I have planned so far for this project include:
- Specify purchase dates
- Warn the user once they reach a user-defined threshold of spending within their budget
- A more detailed overview of monthly spending, including graphs and other visualizations
- Edit expenses/expense categories that have already been tracked
- Allow the user to add custom categories for expenses

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add a purchase to my monthly record
- As a user, I want to be able to view my expenses across a month
- As a user, I want to be able to set a monthly budget
- As a user, I want to be able to categorize my expenses
