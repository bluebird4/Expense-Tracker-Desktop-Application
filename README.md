# Personal Expense Tracker

An application to track personal expenses and assist in keeping a monthly budget. This application
is meant for use by the general population, aimed specifically at those new to expense tracking and
budgeting.

I chose to create this application as my project because I have little experience in tracking my
expenses, and I would like to start doing so. I don't like any of the expense tracker applications
that are currently available for use, and I would like something more refined than a spreadsheet,
so I decided to make my own application for this purpose.

## Planned Features

Some features I have planned so far for this project include:
- Categorize expenses
- Specify purchase dates
- See a monthly overview of spending
- Set a monthly budget
- Warn the user once they reach a user-defined threshold of spending within their budget
