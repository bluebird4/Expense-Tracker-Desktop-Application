# Personal Expense Tracker

An application to track personal expenses and assist in keeping a monthly budget. This application
is meant for use by the general population, aimed specifically at those new to expense tracking and
budgeting.

This application was created as a project for a second-year software construction course. I chose
this specific application because I had little experience in tracking my expenses, and I wanted to
start doing so. I didn't like any of the expense tracker applications that were available for use
at the time, and I also wanted something more refined than a spreadsheet, so I decided to make my
own application for this purpose.

The code in this application is exactly as it was when I submitted it for final grading in my course,
so there are not many features, and I do not currently plan on adding any new features to it. Rather,
I am planning to create a mobile app as a replacement.

## Application Features

- Add a purchase to a monthly record
- View expenses across a month
- Set a monthly budget
- Categorize expenses
- Save monthly record automatically to file after making changes
- Load monthly record automatically from file at application startup
- Notification sound is played when record is autosaved
